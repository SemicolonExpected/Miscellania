# US School Districts


## Info

List of all school districts was taken from the [NCES database](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/) A direct link to the data file is [here](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/data/zip/ccd_lea_029_2223_w_1a_083023.zip).

We then cleaned up the data using `cleaner.py` and scraped fiscal information from each distrct's individual entry in the NCES database. For example, the information for the Cave Creek Unified District is [here](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/districtsearch/district_detail.asp?Search=1&State=04&DistrictPageNum=11&ID2=0400001).
